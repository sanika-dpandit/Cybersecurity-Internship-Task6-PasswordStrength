Password Strength Evaluation üîê

Objective
To understand what makes a password strong by creating and evaluating multiple passwords using online strength-checking tools.

Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)
- [Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://www.kaspersky.com/password-check)

Password Evaluation

1. `sanika123`
- Result: Weak
- Reason: Contains only lowercase letters and digits. Very predictable and short.
- Crack Time: Less than a second

2. `Sanika123`
- Result: Moderate
- Reason: Introduced uppercase letter. Still based on a name and numbers.
- Crack Time: A few seconds to a minute

3. `Sanika@123`
- Result: Strong
- Reason: Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and a symbol.
- Crack Time: Several hours

4. `S@niKa!2025#`
- Result: Very Strong
- Reason: Multiple special characters, mixed casing, non-linear structure, good length.
- Crack Time: Several years

Summary & Learnings
Through this task, I explored how password complexity affects its strength and resistance to attacks. Strong passwords should:
- Be at least 12‚Äì16 characters long
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Avoid personal information like names, birthdays, or common phrases
- Be unpredictable and unique

Using a password manager can help generate and store strong passwords securely. Also, enabling **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** adds another critical layer of security.
